        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
          <p><i>INTRODUCTION</i></br>Basketball is a handball game usually played by two teams of five players on the court. A basketball is a spherical object that rolls and bounces. The objective is to get the ball through a hoop mounted high on a backboard at back end. It is a very popular sport worldwide, played with a round and usually orange ball that bounces. Basketball players mainly use skills such as dribbling, shooting, running, and jumping.

		The game is played between men's teams or between women's teams.</br>
		<i>RULES:</i>
		</br>The rules of basketball can vary slightly depending on the level of play (for example professional rules differ from college rules) or where the game is played (international rules are different from USA professional rules). These rule differences, however, are usually just variations on the basic game of basketball and the majority of the rules discussed below can be applied to most any game of basketball played. 

		The winner of a basketball game is the team with the most points. You get points by throwing the basketball through the opponent's hoop or basket. In regular play a basket made from within the three point line is worth 2 points and a basket shot from outside the three point line is worth three points. When shooting a free throw, each free throw is worth 1 point. 
		</br>
		<b>Rules for the offense </b></br>

		The basketball team on offense is the team with the basketball. When a player has the basketball there are certain rules they must follow: 

		1)	The player must bounce, or dribble, the ball with one hand while moving both feet. If, at any time, both hands touch the ball or the player stops dribbling, the player must only move one foot. The foot that is stationary is called the pivot foot. 

		2)	The basketball player can only take one turn at dribbling. In other words, once a player has stopped dribbling they cannot start another dribble. A player who starts dribbling again is called for a double-dribbling violation and looses the basketball to the other team. A player can only start another dribble after another player from either team touches or gains control of the basketball. This is usually after a shot or pass. 

		3)	The ball must stay in bounds. If the offensive team looses the ball out of bounds the other team gets control of the basketball. 

		4)	The players hand must be on top of the ball while dribbling. If they touch the bottom of the basketball while dribbling and continue to dribble this is called carrying the ball and the player will lose the ball to the other team. 

		5)	Once the offensive team crosses half court, they may not go back into the backcourt. This is called a backcourt violation. If the defensive team knocks the ball into the backcourt, then the offensive team can recover the ball legally.

		</br>
		<b>Defensive Rules </b></br>

		The team on defense is the team without the basketball. 

		1)	The main rule for the defensive player is not to foul. A foul is described as gaining an unfair advantage through physical contact. There is some interpretation that has to be made by the referee, but, in general, the defensive player may not touch the offensive player in a way that causes the offensive player to lose the ball or miss a shot. 
		</br>
		<b>Rules for everyone </b></br>

		1)	Although the foul rule is described above as a defensive rule, it applies exactly the same to all players on the court including offensive players. 

		2)	Basketball players cannot kick the ball or hit it with their fist. 

		3)	No player can touch the basketball while it is traveling downward towards the basket or if it is on the rim. This is called goaltending. (touching the ball on the rim is legal in some games). 

		Every player on the court is subject to the same rules regardless of the position they play. The positions in basketball are just for team basketball strategy and there are no positions in the rules.

          <p> <i>INTRODUCTION</i>
		</br>
			

		Football (Soccer) is one of the oldest sports in the world and with that; it’s also one of the most recognised. The pinnacle of the international game comes in the form the Football World Cup. There are also tournament such as the Euro Championships, Copa America and the African Cup of Nations. Domestically the strongest leagues come from England (English Premier League), Spain (La Liga), Italy (Serie A) and Germany (Bundesliga). In parts of the world the sport is also known as Soccer
		</br>
		<i>RULES:</i>
		</br>
		The aim of football is to score more goals then your opponent in a 90 minute playing time frame. The match is split up into two halves of 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes players will take a 15 minute rest period called half time. The second 45 minutes will resume and any time deemed fit to be added on by the referee (injury time) will be accordingly
		</br>
	A match consists of two 45 minutes halves with a 15 minute rest period in between.
Each team can have a minimum off 11 players (including 1 goalkeeper who is the only player allowed to handle the ball within the 18 yard box) and a minimum of 7 players are needed to constitute a match.
The field must be made of either artificial or natural grass. The size of pitches is allowed to vary but must be within 100-130 yards long and 50-100 yards wide. The pitch must also be marked with a rectangular shape around the outside showing out of bounds, two six yard boxes, two 18 yard boxes and a centre circle. A spot for a penalty placed 12 yards out of both goals and centre circle must also be visible.
The ball must have a circumference of 58-61cm and be of a circular shape.
Each team can name up to 7 substitute players. Substitutions can be made at any time of the match with each team being able to make a maximum of 3 substitutions per side. In the event of all three substitutes being made and a player having to leave the field for injury the team will be forced to play without a replacement for that player.
Each game must include one referee and two assistant referee’s (linesmen). It’s the job of the referee to act as time keeper and make any decisions which may need to be made such as fouls, free kicks, throw ins, penalties and added on time at the end of each half. The referee may consult the assistant referees at any time in the match regarding a decision. It’s the assistant referee’s job to spot offside’s in the match (see below), throw ins for either team and also assist the referee in all decision making processes where appropriate.
If the game needs to head to extra time as a result of both teams being level in a match then 30 minutes will be added in the form of two 15 minute halves after the allotted 90 minutes.
If teams are still level after extra time then a penalty shootout must take place.
The whole ball must cross the goal line for it to constitute as a goal.
For fouls committed a player could receive either a yellow or red card depending on the severity of the foul; this comes down to the referee’s discretion. The yellow is a warning and a red card is a dismissal of that player. Two yellow cards will equal one red. Once a player is sent off then they cannot be replaced.
If a ball goes out of play off an opponent in either of the side lines then it is given as a throw in. If it goes out of play off an attacking player on the base line then it is a goal kick. If it comes off a defending player it is a corner kick.

          <p> <i>INTRODUCTION</i>
		</br>
			Have-a-Go Cricket is a Cricket New Zealand initiative that delivers an introductory cricket program for children aged 5 to 8 years. Children are introduced to basic skills and the principles of cricket in a fun and safe environment.

Children up to college age can then graduate onto the Kiwi Cricket program. This is a games based program that builds on the introductory skills and principles learnt whilst undertaking the Have-A-Go program.

Boys and girls can begin playing for a team at their local cricket club from the age of five.

</br><i>Rules of the game:</i></br>
The basic rules of cricket are;

A match is played between two teams with each team having eleven players (junior cricket teams sometimes have eight players). One player from each team is the designated captain.
One team fields while the other team is the batting side.
The fielding team bowls the cricket ball at the batsmen who tries to hit the ball with their bat. The fielding team is trying to get the batsmen out whilst the batting team is trying to score as many runs as they can without getting out.
One bowler will bowl what is called ‘an over.’ On over consists of six balls. Off each delivery a batsmen can either not score or score 1 through to 6.
If a ball is hit to the boundary along the ground it is worth four runs. If a ball is hit over the boundary it is worth six runs.
Each batting team is allowed to lose 10 wickets before they must switch around and be the bowling team (or 7 wickets for an 8-a-side team).
The object of the game is to score more runs than the opposing team.

</br><i>Suitability:</i></br>
Cricket is suitable for boys and girls to participate in from an early age. Children from the age of 5 years old can begin to learn cricket by participating in the Have-A-Go program.

The Have-A-Go program in conjunction with the Kiwi Cricket  program provides an excellent pathway for children into competitive cricket. There are many junior cricket clubs for both boys and girls to join and begin playing competitive games.

Cricket is a non contact sport but, for older children it is played with a hard cricket ball, so the appropriate protective clothing must be worn to ensure the safety of the children.

Cricket is a great way for children to learn to work together in a team environment whilst developing important physical and mental skills.

<br><i>Sign up dates:</i></br>
As cricket is a summer sport sign up dates for the season for clubs typically begin in late August. Contact your local club for specific registration details for the coming season. Even if the registration period has elapsed it is advised that you enquire as there may still be places in teams available for your child.

</br><i>Sporting tips:</i></br>
To successfully participate in cricket you require;

Good hand/eye coordination
Adequate ball skills, in particular throwing and catching
Excellent mental application and concentration
The ability to cope and concentrate in sometimes harsh summer conditions

          <p> <i>INTRODUCTION</i>
		</br>
			

		Chess is believed to have been invented 1500 years ago in India. The game has changed only slightly since then with the advent of the queen in the 15th century and some minor movement adjustments in the 1800s.

</br><i>Chess game goal</i></br>
The ultimate aim in the chess game is delivering a checkmate – trapping your opponent´s king. The term checkmate is an alteration of the Persian phrase “Shah Mat”, meaning literally, “the King is ambushed”, and not “the King is dead”, that is a common misconception.

</br><i>General Chess Rules</i></br>
White is always first to move and players take turns alternately moving one piece at a time. Movement is required. If a player´s turn is to move, he is not in check but has no legal moves, this situation is called “Stalemate” and it ends the game in a draw.

Each type of piece has its own method of movement. A piece may be moved to another position or may capture an opponent´s piece, replacing on its square (en passant being the only exception). With the exception of the knight, a piece may not move over or through any of the other pieces.

When a king is threatened with capture (but can protect himself or escape), it´s called check. If a king is in check, then the player must make a move that eliminates the threat of capture and cannot leave the king in check.

Checkmate happens when a king is placed in check and there is no legal move to escape. Checkmate ends the game and the side whose king was checkmated looses. Chess for kids would be a great option to help the kid enhance his thinking capability with the chess strategies involved.

</br><i>The initial position setup</i><br>
The chessboard is made up of eight rows and eight columns for a total of 64 squares of alternating colors. Each square of the chessboard is identified with a unique pair of a letter and a number. The vertical files are labeled a through h, from White´s left (i.e. the queenside) to White´s right. Similarly, the horizontal ranks are numbered from 1 to 8, starting from the one nearest White´s side of the board. Each square of the board, then, is uniquely identified by its file letter and rank number.

In the initial position setup, the light queen is positioned on a light square and the dark queen is situated on a dark square.

</br<i>Chess moves</br><i>
King can move exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. At most once in every game, each king is allowed to make a special move, known as castling.
Queen can move any number of vacant squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.
Rook can move any number of vacant squares vertically or horizontally. It also is moved while castling.
Bishop can move any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction.
Knight can move one square along any rank or file and then at an angle. The knight´s movement can also be viewed as an “L” or “7″ laid out at any horizontal or vertical angle.
Pawns can move forward one square, if that square is unoccupied. If it has not yet moved, the pawn has the option of moving two squares forward provided both squares in front of the pawn are unoccupied. A pawn cannot move backward. Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. They can capture an enemy piece on either of the two spaces adjacent to the space in front of them (i.e., the two squares diagonally in front of them) but cannot move to these spaces if they are vacant. The pawn is also involved in the two special moves en passant and promotion.
</br><i>Castling</i></br>
Castling is the only time in the chess game when more than one piece moves during a turn. This chess move has been invented in the 1500´s to help speeding up the game and improving balance of the offense and defense.

During the castling, the king moves two squares towards the rook he intends to castle with, and the rook moves to the square through which the king passed.

Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:

Neither king nor rook involved in castling may have moved from the original position;
There must be no pieces between the king and the rook;
The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square)

</br><i>En Passant</i></br>
En Passant may only occur when a pawn is moved two squares on its initial movement. When this happens, the opposing player has the option to take the moved pawn “en passant” as if it had only moved one square. This option, though, only stays open for one move.
The En Passant move was developed after pawns were allowed to move more than one square on their initial move. The idea behind this rule was to retain restrictions imposed by slow movement, while at the same time speeding up the game.

</br><i>Pawn promotion</i></br>
If a pawn reaches the opponent´s edge of the table, it will be promoted – the pawn may be converted to a queen, rook, bishop or knight, as the player desires. The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. Thus its´ theoretically possible having up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all pawns are promoted.

        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
          <p> <i>INTRODUCTION</i>
		</br>
		Badminton is one of the most popular racquet sports in Singapore. Equipments are relatively inexpensive which makes it easy for new players to take up the sport. To get started, all you need is a badminton court, net, racquets and shuttlecocks.

Badminton is fun which makes it a good activity for family and friends to bond. At the same time, it is also an effective calorie-burner that not only builds strength but put your reflexes to the test. After all, players are required to run, lunge, stretch, leap and jump around the 20 x 44 feet rectangular court.			

Here is a breakdown of badminton rules based on “Laws of Badminton Regulations 2013/2014” by the Badminton World Federation.

</br><i>The coin toss – who goes first?</i></br>

Before a tournament starts, a coin is tossed.  The winner of the coin toss will then get to choose either

1) to serve or to receive   or

2) the preferred side of the court.

The loser of the coin toss will then exercise the remaining choice. 

</br><i>Service</i></br>

A serve is delivered diagonally across the courts. During service, both the server and receiver must stand at diagonally opposite sides without touching the boundary lines of the badminton courts. During a serve, the point at which the racquet is allowed to come into contact with the shuttlecock must happen below the server’s waist.

</br><i>Rally</i></br>

A rally starts with a serve, often times continuing with a series of shots exchanged between opposing sides before it finally ends when a point is scored.

Badminton Scoring System – 3 (games) x 21 (points)

The 3 (game sets) x 21 (points) scoring system was first introduced in December 2005 and is now the official scoring system used at professional tournaments. Despite the official updates to the rules, some recreational players (particularly those who have been playing badminton for many years) still follow the traditional scoring system.

A badminton match consists of three games.
